        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>Hello! My name is Huimin and I will be 26 years young this year. I studied Economics and Philosophy in college but picked up a 
        personal interest in coding when I registered for a programming course during my third year. Since then I teach myself through online courses and
        attending workshops such as Techladies where I can speak to and learn from industry experts.</p>
        
        <p>My friends describe me as easy going, trustworthy, organized and a good listener. I love lasagne, books, the sun and dogs. 
        See a short video on dogs below!</p>
